            <p>
                Hello! I‚Äôm Efrata Melese, a passionate and driven 20-year-old software engineering student at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. 
                Currently in my second year, I am deeply fascinated by technology and its potential to transform lives. My focus right now is on 
                front-end web development, where I combine creativity with coding to build engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. 
                I‚Äôm constantly learning and experimenting with new tools and frameworks to enhance my skills and stay ahead in this fast-evolving field. 
                When I‚Äôm not coding, I enjoy problem-solving, collaborating on projects, and exploring innovative ways to make the web more accessible
                and interactive. Let‚Äôs connect and create something amazing together!
            </p>

                    A Python-based utility for efficient text manipulation.
                    This mini project on text processing explores the 
                    textual and phonemic similarities between these two languages.
                    It is  designed to analyze and compare text from Amharic and Geez documents,
                    performs several tasks, including reading and processing text 
                    from Word documents, converting text from Ethiopic script to Latin script,
                    converting Latin text to phonemes, and computing overlaps at both the word and phoneme levels.

                <br>
                <dd>
                    This project implements a very basic version control system
                    after the model of Git, called MiniGit. It supports essential
                    functionality including initializing a repository, adding files, 
                    committing files, creating branches, checking out branches/commits, 
                    logging history, merging branches, and viewing diffs between commits.

                <dd>
                    The implementation of the CareConnectDB system provides a robust and scalable database 
                    solution designed to efficiently manage the time and resources of college counsellors. By 
                    integrating various roles such as counsellors, first-aid givers, and health support administrators, 
                    the system ensures streamlined access to critical health and psychological support services. The 
                    database design follows best practices, including normalization to minimize redundancy, 
                    indexing for performance optimization, and security measures to protect sensitive data. The 
                    implementation phase involved rigorous testing to validate database integrity, data consistency, 
                    and query efficiency.
